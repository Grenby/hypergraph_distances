# Hypergraph distances
This repository aims at studying distances on different graphs and hypergraphs.

## Overview of the problem of distances in hypergraphs
Overall there is a natural distance, which one defines on graphs, which also induces a natural metrics on graph, the shortest path distance. For defining the same for hypergraphs one needs to first define the analogy of the path, then define the distances based on the extended notion of the shortest paths.
As shown here even for the unweighted hypergraphs there may be several notions defined https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/25/6/923

We are considering and defining the distances for weighted hypergraphs here which may lead to different results of distances depending on which hypergraph projectsions would you choose (line-graph vs. clique-graph).
The repository is under the development.
